## Overview
The current repository has been created to keep trace over my graduation thesis' project on Neuroevolution. The project's main goal was to evolve the skills of launcher (controlled by neural networks) to hit a target, throwing projectiles of variable weight. More in detail the goal was to train the neural network associated to a launcher to hit a given target, where the throws are evaluated as good as closer to its target, and to show the results in a simulation. Genetic algorithms have been used to train the neural networks and Java Swing has been used to create an interface and to show the simulations obtained by the networks during the training phase and also after that, by loading already trained neural networks (with the possibility to change their inputs).
